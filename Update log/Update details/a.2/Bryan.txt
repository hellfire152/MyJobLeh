Done:
ApplyJob notifies you whenever u apply for job
Added EditPersonalDialog.fxml for JFXDialog in profile2.fxml
Allow popup for you to edit your details(not working fully because require database)


Issues faced:
1. When u click on the edit button for the about me in profile2.fxml, it uses the method loadAboutMe 
it does not allow me to use my own button created in EditPersonalDialog.fxml, it will give me a NullPointerError, so i have 
created a button1 that works but it does not fit with the alignment,
2. Need of database records to be able to start on dynamic contents for Employeehome, ApplyJob and profile page(generating of resume)
3.Scrollbar problem on home2.fxml 

Still doing:
1.Dark theme
2.Popup notification
3.Drawer's dropdown popup
4.Transition
