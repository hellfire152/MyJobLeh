Files Changed:
A LOT OF STUFF IN DATAACCESS //kill me now
model.Validator::validatePassword -> '!', '^', '&', and '*' now all count as symbols!
controller.LoginController::handleLogin + AccountDAO_Sql::getAccount + AccountDAO_Sql::createAccount ->
now checks for an existing account before adding anything to the database

JobsDAO_Sql::createAccount -> now checks for an existing job before adding to database
JobsDAO_Sql::deleteJob -> now defined

view.employee.Registraion.fxml -> because the fx:ids and stuff weren't set properly for some reason,
probably something happened when we were handing files back and forth
controller.employee.RegisterController.java -> Now properly adds an account to database, after checking if any accounts of that email exists
