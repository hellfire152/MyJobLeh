27/1/2017 - Ver. b.2

New package Added: model.extraWindows -> for anything that launches a new window

Files added:
model.extraWindows.ApplyJobWindow.java -> for employee, launches a new window when viewing job details

Files moved:
ApplyJob.fxml to view.employee,
ApplyJobController.java to controller.employee

Files edited:
application.MyJobLeh::swapScene -> now returns the Controller as an Object

dataAccess.sql:
	>DatabaseAccessor.java			-> New bytesToObject method to shorten code
	>AccountDAO_Sql.java			-> To fit the new SQL tables + shortened code
	>JobsDAO_Sql.java				----^
	
controller.employee.ApplyJobController -> setWorkEvent to initialize all the various components appropriately
controller.employee.HomeController, HomePaneController -> work dynamically + launch apply job in new window

model.event.WorkEvent -> static getAllWorkArr method to... get all WorkEvents in the database!

Database tables have changed as well. The "pending_employees" and "accepted_employees" columns have been removed,
their purpose now fulfilled by the "pending_to_jobs" and the "accepted_to_jobs" junction tables.

A whole bunch of methods were added to JobsDAO, thanks to the many-to-many relation between employee and jobs.

Files Edited:

In controller.employee:
	>AddApplicantPageController, ApplicantPageController, ListOfEmployeesController, HomeController
		--->All edited to work using a "baton-passing" style of logic
	>CreateJobController
		--->Now properly sets the dates for timetable
	
In model.event:
	>ScheduledEvent
		--->now generates a random color for itself on creation! (for timetable)
			+color now works of HSB values, with fixed saturation and brightness, variable hue,
			displayed as a String, with an additional float for the hue value
			
In model.timetable:
	>Timetable
		--->Now able to get data and display them properly!
	>TimetableCell
		--->Made code more readable with some delegate methods
	>LegendItem
		--->Updated to work off the float hue value
		
Qing Ning's and my part are now working together!
